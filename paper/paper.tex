\section{Research Method}\label{sec:method}
The goal of this study is to understand whether GitHub repositories can be
classified as sample or real. This leads to the following research questions:
\begin{description}
    \item[RQ1] Can transformers classify GitHub repository on real and
    sample based on text data gained about repository?
    \item[RQ2] Can transformers outperform traditional ML classification
    algorithms like Random-Forest in task of classifying GitHub repositories on
    real and sample?
    \item[RQ3] What is the most suitable technique for classifying GitHub
    repositories on real and sample?
\end{description}

%First, we prepared a training dataset of 1,000 public GitHub repositories.
%It is important to have both: real projects and repositories with examples.
%We distributed number of repositories between real and samples 750 and 250
%respectively. Sample repositories were queried like that: 84 repositories
%that contain \ff{examples} in their name, 83 repositories named with
%\ff{samples}, and 83 contain \ff{guides} in their name.
%For each GitHub repository we collected the following features:
%\begin{inparaenum}[1)]
%    \item \ff{description}: repository's description
%    \item \ff{readme}: README.md file
%    \item \ff{created\_at}: date when repository was created
%    \item \ff{last\_commit}: latest commit date
%    \item \ff{commits}: total amount of commits
%\end{inparaenum}
%
%Second, we label our dataset using numeric labels. The real repository labeled
%as 0, while sample one labeled as 1. To automate the process of labeling we
%utilize pattern-matching script. We run pattern matching for repository's full
%name e.g.: \ff{yegor256/takes}, \ff{apache/kafka}, and it's description. For
%instance, \ff{leeowenowen/rxjava-examples} will match, while
%\ff{objectionary/eo} won't.
%
%% feed different data?
%Third, we prepare dataset to be presented to the model as input. For this
%purpose we preprocess data using techniques of tokenization and stopwords
%removal. After this step, we feed this dataset by learning both, machine
%learning model with Random-Forest algorithm, and deep learning text
%transformers as motivated in RQ2.
%
%Finally, we collect and compare the results, produced by trained models.
%
%All GitHub repositories we collected are public repositories with more than
%20 stars.
