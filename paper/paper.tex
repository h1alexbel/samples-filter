\section{Research Method}\label{sec:method}
The goal of this study is to understand whether GitHub repositories can be
classified as sample or real. This leads to the following research questions:
\begin{description}
    \item[RQ1] Do text transformers can predict classes based on text?
    \item[RQ2] Which technique performs better in task to classify GitHub repositories on real and sample?
\end{description}

    First, we prepared a dataset of 1,000 public GitHub repositories.
    It is important to have both: real projects and repositories with examples.
    We distributed number of repositories between real and samples 750 and 250
    respectively.

    Second, we label our dataset,\ldots
